Global Life Expectancy Over Time\nThe first plot tracks the global average life expectancy for each year in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this shows\n\nThere is a steady upward trend from the early 1990s through the late 2010s.\nAverage life expectancy rises by several years over the period, reflecting broad improvements in health, medicine, and living standards.\nThe slight dip at the end of the series suggests recent shocks (COVID-19 Pandemic) that temporarily disrupt this long-run progress."

Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita\nThis scatterplot relates log₁₀(GDP per capita) to life expectancy for all country-year observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this shows\n\nThere is a clear positive relationship: richer countries tend to have higher life expectancy.\nThe curve flattens at higher income levels, consistent with diminishing returns, once basic needs and health systems are in place, extra income buys smaller gains in longevity.\nThe spread at lower GDP levels highlights that countries with similar incomes can have quite different health outcomes."

Relationship Between GDP and CO₂ Emissions\nHere we look at how economic activity is linked to CO₂ emissions, using log-transformed variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this shows\n\nThere is a strong positive correlation between log(GDP per capita) and log(CO₂ per capita).\nAs countries get richer, they generally emit more CO₂ per person, especially in the mid- to high-income ranges."

    "text": "Summary\nTogether, these EDA plots highlight several key themes:\n\nLife expectancy has improved globally, but not uniformly across countries or time.\nEconomic development (GDP per capita) is strongly associated with both higher life expectancy and higher CO₂ emissions, creating a tension between health and environmental sustainability.\nThe predictors used in the regression models—GDP per capita, CO₂ per capita, and year—each capture distinct but related aspects of this story, which is reflected in both the scatterplots and the correlation matrix."
