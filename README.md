# Life_Expectancy_Project

This project builds and compares several regression models attempting to predict life expectancy based on the variables of GDP per capita, CO2 emissions per capita, and year. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results through a Quarto website.

## Description

### Project Overview
The goals of this project are:
1. To preprocess, clean, and merge the 2 datasets we found.
2. Train a flaml machine learning algorithm to select the best model to predict life expectancy. Based on the year, GDP per capita, and CO2 emissions per capita.
3. Evaluate and compare the performance of these models using RMSE, MAE and R^2.
4. Visualize the results and findings in a Quarto website.
