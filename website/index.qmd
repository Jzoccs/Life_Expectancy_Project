# Overview

This website presents our complete workflow for exploring, modeling, and visualizing global **life expectancy** using a socioeconomic and an environmental predictor.  
Our goal was to understand **how a nation’s development and emissions relate to population health**, and to build models that can predict life expectancy using accessible global indicators.

Below is a guide to what each page of this website contains:

---

## Home (You are here)
Provides a summary of the project goals, problem statement, and navigational overview of all sections.

---

## Data
Shows the **raw, unprocessed datasets** retrieved from:

- World Bank (GDP per capita)
- World Bank (Life Expectancy)
- Our World in Data (CO₂ emissions per capita)

This page provides transparency by previewing the original data before cleaning and merging.

## Visualizations
Includes:

- Animated global scatterplots  
- Faceted comparisons by continent  
- Multi-axis trend charts for Life Expectancy, GDP, and CO₂  
- Interactive widgets  

These help uncover relationships that are not obvious from raw numbers.

---

## Regression Analysis
An interactive dashboard where users can:

- Select model families (LGBM, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Adjust training time  
- Compare algorithms by RMSE, MAE, and R²  
- View prediction examples and plots  

This showcases the modeling performance and results.

# Problem Statement

**How can we estimate a country’s life expectancy using accessible global indicators like GDP per capita and CO₂ emissions per capita?**

It is widely known that higher income levels are linked to better health and longer lifespans. However, we wanted to explore two questions within our dataset:

- How strong is the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy?
- Do CO₂ emissions per capita provide any additional insights that explain differences between countries?

GDP per capita reflects general economic conditions, which often affect healthcare quality, nutrition, and public resources. CO₂ emissions per capita, while not a direct health measure, can indicate levels of industrial activity and development.

By including both variables, our aim was simply to see:

- Whether CO₂ helps improve prediction accuracy
- Whether economic and environmental indicators together offer a clearer picture than GDP alone

Our goal is not to make causal claims, but to create reasonable predictive models and examine patterns in the data.

# Approach

To answer these questions, we:

- Retrieved publicly available global datasets  
- Cleaned, filtered, and merged them into one analytical dataset  
- Explored trends and correlations using visualizations  
- Used AutoML to test multiple regression models  
- Compared model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R²  

Each page of this website walks through a different part of that process.
